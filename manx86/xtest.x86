.SH DESCRIPTION
The XTEST instruction queries the transactional execution status. If the
instruction executes inside a transactionally executing RTM region or a
transactionally executing HLE region, then the ZF flag is cleared, else
it is set.

.SH OPERATION
.SS XTEST
.EX
IF (RTM_ACTIVE = 1 OR HLE_ACTIVE = 1)
    THEN
        ZF := 0
    ELSE
        ZF := 1
FI;
.EE

.SH FLAGS AFFECTED
The ZF flag is cleared if the instruction is executed transactionally;
otherwise it is set to 1. The CF, OF, SF, PF, and AF, flags are cleared.
